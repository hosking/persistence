# Simple Transactions Post-v1 Extensions

This document discusses various extensions which seem desirable for
comprehensive support of transactions, but are intentionally left out of the
[MVP](MVP.md), in order to keep its scope manageable.

Over the course of implementing and validating the MVP, it is possible that
features in this list may be promoted to the MVP if experience shows that MVP
performance would not otherwise be viable or the benefits outweigh any added
complexity and costs.

See [overview](Overview.md) for addition background.

* Closed nested transactions
* Open nested transactions
* Transactional interface to host / extern facilities
* Persistence
* Logging metadata about committed transactions
* Object format / type evolution
* Persistence of threads
* Weak references

**TODO**:  Add sketches of some or all of these.
